blog, online store opening by 3025.

this repo is public so that authentication doesnt get in my way. If you are reading this, dont.
well you can read it if you really want to, lol

A simple blog intended to document various jewellry projects, coding projects and random musings. 

should have the ability to follow split trains of thought relatively fluidly, in a tree-like way.
Images should load fast.

worthy pages may ascend to html/css
most will likely stay as MD

use directory structure

maybe write a simple utility to organise things in a neat manner? figure it out later
